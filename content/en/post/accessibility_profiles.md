In the definition of our mission and vision, Metadocencia is defined as _“an inclusive and collaborative community”_ that develops _“open, reusable and accessible resources”_. To define different accessibility profiles for reviewing the materials we offer, we work with an accessibility team: Iván Gabriel Poggio, Mariela Rajngewerc and Patricia A. Loto, 

We know that it is always possible to improve our work, which is presented as dynamic and permanent, always keeping _people_ at the center of our work.

We are open to suggestions for improvements and warnings of possible barriers to accessing our material. At the end of this note you will find an email address to write to us.

We present this first description of profiles of people with disabilities to organize the different requirements and achieve material that is accessible to the greatest number of people.
