In July, [Nature Human Behavior](https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/) invited MetaDocencia to write a reflection on the ethical challenges that generative artificial intelligence (AI) poses to Open Science. Since this was a topic we begun to discuss with Gregory Randall and Lorena Etcheverry, colleagues from the Universidad de la República (Uruguay), after the [Ethics in AI Panel](https://youtu.be/yiY7WJrJxI8?si=JGliEz6iDjeR7Hj3&t=6913) at the [Latin American AI Meeting - Khipu 2023](https://khipu.ai/khipu2023/) in March, we invited them to join in the eight-handed writing (and several more, as you can seen in the acknowledgments!) of this opinion piece that is part of [“Navigating the AI frontier”](https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/volumes/7/issues/11), the journal´s last issue that focuses on AI.

We are also proud that, following the recommendations proposed by the article by Amano and colleagues (2021) ["Ten tips for overcoming language barriers in science"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01137-1.epdf?sharing_token=RMjsKk9OG3znVh8pEWbk5dRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OR4J0u4q6gAmV_weMB193c2c1IWOUHcWpTfozSp4AYY-seT8QfbhJ-GTdooigbYWuZK_c8QfohDErKpD1F3NeA5y0W2IXXDCDNWverFwKHtA9a_-rnLIxXD78Xcb9RnzM%3D) and Nature Human Behaviour editorial principles (2023) which recognize that ["Scientific publishing has a language problem"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01679-6), the journal enabled a bilingual publication. **You can find our article in English at the following link: [https://rdcu.be/drzox](https://rdcu.be/drzox).** The full article in Spanish is at: [https://www.readcube.com/articles/supplement?doi=10.1038%2Fs41562-023-01740-4&index=0](https://www.readcube.com/articles/supplement?doi=10.1038%2Fs41562-023-01740-4&index=0).

We hope you find the article interesting and invite you to continue the debate on our [Spanish-speaking Slack workspace](https://w3id.org/metadocencia/slack).
