### Summary of the Summary ✅
2023 was a complex year for education and science, as certain technological developments brought into discussion the importance of knowledge as a collective construction in which people, and not algorithms, are the protagonists.

Furthermore, many of the changes brought to us by the COVID-19 pandemic fully coexisted for the first time with previous practices, and “hybrid” life confronted us with new challenges and adaptations.

At MetaDocencia we also went through changes and learnings: after establishing a more stable position thanks to the founding support of the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/), we joined in promoting the development of open science in Spanish-speaking communities along with [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), within the framework of the [NASA TOPS](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) initiative. We are happy for this new space of opportunity to continue doing capacity building.

Our team grew. We published, attended events, enlarged our hive of fellow communities, weaved networks and deepened the formalization of our processes to continue building skills and inclusive communities of open science in Spanish.

In this report, we would like to share data about all we have done in the past year, and highlight that it was possible due to the support, exchange, and collaboration of our entire community.

# Community 🙌
In 2023, the MetaDocencia team had representatives in over **20 local and international conferences**.

In addition, we supported the dissemination of more than 50 events organized by fellow communities and linked to the topics we work on.

International and regional conferences allow us to further connect with other communities of practice, build alliances, and be visible to new funders.
Here are a few milestones of our community in 2023, month by month:

## January - February
These are the #SummerMode months in South America and, although our channels remain active, it is the time in which many people take vacations and organize the work for the rest of the year.
In January and February of 2023 we continued to build community locally, yet always with a global outlook, and met with fellow communities from the North. [Paz Míguez](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/authors/pazmiguez/), [Nicolás Palopoli](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/authors/npalopoli/), and [Laura Ación](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/authors/lacion/) met in London with [Malvika Sharan](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/authors/malvikasharan/) and [Yo Yehudi](https://twitter.com/yoyehudi), two of the directors of our fellow community [OLS](https://openlifesci.org/). They planned collaborative work during the year, visited [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and took the opportunity to strengthen our collaborative network.

## April

### Accelerating Open Science in Latin America
On April 17 and 18 we participated in the workshop "Accelerating Open Science in Latin America" #CZILatAmMtg, organized by the #OpenScience area of CZI. After two intense days of work focused on the needs and capacity building in Latin America, we ended this stage of the conversations with great satisfaction and community strengthening.
Connecting with the scientific and research community is essential to learn and think about the interests of our region, from our region.

### We Gave the Manzanita Awards
After a great year of work, challenges, and joys shared among this beautiful team, we decided to reward each one’s contributions in a playful ceremony with a virtual and symbolic award that we called the “Manzanita Awards”.
We toast to the path we have traveled and to everything that is yet to come.

<p align="center">

<i><font size="-0.6">Screenshot of the first “Manzanita Awards Gala”.</font></i>
</p>

We are sorry that due to a force majeure event [Moni Alonso](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/authors/monialonso/) could not receive her award live, but the gala was extended for a few more days and all the way to social media. Check out the Twitter thread (in Spanish):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">🏆 ¡Compartimos la gala de los Premios Manzanita 2023!<br>🍎 Después de un gran año de trabajo, desafíos y alegrías compartidas con este grupo hermoso, decidimos premiar en una ceremonia lúdica el enorme valor de las contribuciones de cada integrante. <a href="https://t.co/rmdjluCoKG">pic.twitter.com/rmdjluCoKG</a></p>&mdash; MetaDocencia (@MetaDocencia@floss.social) (@metadocencia) <a href="https://twitter.com/metadocencia/status/1738237948397576451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2023</a></blockquote>

*Moni's Manzanita Award, among others, was shared on social media.*



#### Our Community, in Data 📈
In 2023, we generated a lot of content for social media and our website, with the aim of sharing news, ways of working, and our participation in different activities with the extended community of the different channels.

For instance, we are **about to reach the first 100 publications on Zenodo!**
The MetaDocencia community also grew online thanks to the sustained work of our communications team:
The MetaDocencia website saw over **28,000 unique visits**!
Our content on YouTube had over **1,300 views**. That is the platform where anyone can find recordings of our workshops and talks.
On LinkedIn, we gathered 219 more followers.
On Twitter, 440 new accounts followed us–a 17% increase.
On Facebook, 111 more people now follow us and on Instagram, 162. That is 36% more!
Most of our daily communication is done through Slack. Our workspace has been growing since 2020 and currently has 738 members.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://www.metadocencia.org/img/reporte-2023/NASApost.jpg" alt="The news about NASA's award was shared 48 times by our community on Twitter." width="600px"/>
<i><font size="-0.6">The news about NASA's award was shared 48 times by our community on Twitter.</font></i>
</p>

- The 7 published editions of our [bilingual newsletter](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/boletines/) were very well received by 2,065 Spanish-speaking folks in our community (25.7% more than the previous year), with an **opening rate of 41%**.



# Teaching 👩‍💻
In 2023, we organized 10 workshops with 141 attendees, an average of 14 people per event:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://www.metadocencia.org/img/reporte-2023/Asistentes2023_por_curso_ingles.png" alt="Number of attendees per course edition in 2023." width="600px"/>
<i><font size="-0.6">Number of attendees per course edition in 2023.</font></i>
</p>

When analyzing the percentage of attendees to our workshops by country, we see that they are mostly from Spanish-speaking ones, since we address our community in Spanish. **People from 14 different countries joined! 11 of them correspond to Latin America**:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://www.metadocencia.org/img/reporte-2023/Asistentes2023_mapa_porcentajes_Ingles.png" alt="Percentage of attendees per country to courses 2023." width="600px"/>
</p>

By analyzing how attendees heard about MetaDocencia, we see the importance of the diversity of channels, how email has grown as a means of communication, and how important other people’s referral are to generate our community network: 
<p align="center">
<img src="https://www.metadocencia.org/img/reporte-2023/Asistentes2023_como_conocieron_ingles.png" alt="Graph showing how people found out about our 2023 courses." width="600px"/>
</p>

The average net promoter score (NPS), which measures whether people would recommend a workshop, was 96.3, very close to the maximum score of 100.
In October 2023, we held our first hybrid workshop as part of the Argentine Biostatistics Group annual meeting. There were 44 attendees in total.
<p align="center">

<i><font size="-0.6">Workshops page on our website and recordings uploaded to our YouTube channel.</font></i>
</p>

Additionally, we improved and redesigned our workshop and event registration and certification process. Find the materials for each course through the following list:

1. The [Accessible Zoom with a Screen Reader](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/curso/zoom/) workshop was published and taught 3 times between December 2022 and October 2023. There were also 3 editions of [How to Teach Programming Online](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/curso/programar/) and of [Present! Resources for Active Meetings](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/curso/intro-abc-online/). These were our most taught stable courses in 2023.
2. The "MetaEvaluations: Evaluate While Teaching" workshop was improved and piloted twice in November and December 2022.
3. The workshop [Social Impacts of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/curso/etica_en_ia/) was published and taught in person in March 2023, during the Latin American Meeting on Artificial Intelligence (Khipu 2023), in Montevideo (Uruguay).
4. The in-person [Train the Trainer](https://www.metadocencia.org/curso/entrenamiento-instructores/) workshop was adapted to the local audience and delivered with CABANAnet in Buenos Aires (Argentina), in April 2023.

## Workshop Impact Measurement 🎯
To improve how we measure our impact and increase our contribution to the academic literature while using data responsibly (for example, with approval from an external Ethics Committee), we started collaborating with knowledge acquisition researchers from the University of Buenos Aires, verifying the impact of our workshops on attendees.

The methods developed for this research, in collaboration with psychology scholars from the University of Buenos Aires, are under peer review in the open to publish and read journal [Paideia - Journal of Education](https://revistas.udec.cl/index.php/paideia/index) of the University of Concepción, Chile.

## Guides, Instructions, and Work Guidelines 🗂️
MetaDocencia is consolidated as a fully-financed organization with 17 stable team members with different dedication, working remotely, and geographically distributed. This year was fundamental to consolidate the different processes that we went through as an organization and that we expressed in guiding documents that cover many of our activities and exchange spaces. We share them with the goal that they will be useful for other communities, organizations, and people.

- **Infrastructure Plan**, which documents the development of our infrastructure between 2022 and 2023 (in Spanish): [https://zenodo.org/records/10500908](https://zenodo.org/records/10500909)
- **How We Communicate**, the communication plan that we implemented in MetaDocencia in 2022 and 2023 (in Spanish): [https://zenodo.org/records/10277837](https://zenodo.org/records/10277837)
- **Slack Participation Guide**, to ensure that anyone who joins feels comfortable and knows how to contribute to the exchange in this space (in Spanish):[https://zenodo.org/records/10028137](https://zenodo.org/records/10028137) 
- **How We Use Social Media**, our guidelines and suggestions for the use of MetaDocencia’s social media profiles (in Spanish):[https://zenodo.org/records/10277716](https://zenodo.org/records/10277716)
- **Repositorio de Accesibilidad 2022-2023**, a document that compiles digital accessibility-related content shared by MetaDocencia between 2022 and 2023 (in Spanish): [https://zenodo.org/records/10514982](https://zenodo.org/records/10514982)
  
In addition, in September 2023, we carried out a new round of hiring for project coordination. After receiving 134 applications, 3 people were hired. Meet the new team members in this post: [https://www.metadocencia.org/en/post/team2023/](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/post/team2023/).

</p>

Although the majority of applicants were from Argentina, the scope of the job searches was Latin American.

There is diversity among the academic backgrounds of applicants, which enriches the contribution of all the profiles that join the team:

</p>

Applicants’ most recurrent educational level was a completed graduate degree:

</p>

In 2023, we also implemented **parental leave**, in line with our well-being value. It is a specific policy that supports and follows the life projects of MetaDocencia’s team members and we hope it will be a reference for other communities and organizations.


## Projects 💪
### Catalyst
We have been working with partners CCAD, OLS, Invest in Open Infrastructure, 2i2c, CSCCE, and The Carpentries on the [Catalyst Project](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7025288), to offer cloud infrastructure services in Latin America and Africa.

As representatives of Latin America, we are proud to collaborate with other local communities in the biomedical sciences that will be supported by this cloud computing infrastructure.

#### [Consulting services](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/consultoria/)
We have partnered with influential organizations in open science and diversified our consulting services.
- A significant milestone was our collaboration with CZI in organizing the “Accelerating Open Science in Latin America” workshop in Buenos Aires in April 2023. We supported the planning and execution of event activities by contributing to and coordinating a team of local experts.
Other consulting services included:
- Working with [CS&S](https://www.codeforsociety.org/)  to identify and establish connections with Spanish-speaking folks and communities, support the organization of a focus group, and review the final project report;
- Assisting [IOI](https://investinopen.org/) with translation services to support an exploratory research project on open infrastructure needs in Latin America, Africa and Asia; and
- Organizing events on the decolonization of global health in collaboration with the [QUEST Center for Reproducible Research, Berlin Institute of Health @Charité](https://www.bihealth.org/en/translation/innovation-enabler/quest-center).



## Training 🎓
MetaDocencia is committed to the continuous training and development of its team:
- In 2023, we took advantage of many of the opportunities that CZI makes available through its open [Capacity Building](https://chanzuckerberg.com/capacity-building/training-sessions/#:~:text=Capacity%20Building%20Opportunities,impact%20over%20the%20long%2Dterm.) program, some with simultaneous interpretation to Spanish!
- Members of the Communication, Accessibility, and Impact Measurement teams completed the Scientific Community Engagement Fundamentals (CEF) course, taught by the [Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cscce?trk=public_post-text).
<p align="center">
<img src="https://www.metadocencia.org/img/reporte-2023/CSCCE.jpg" alt="Shared CEF course certification." width="600px"/>
<i><font size="-0.6">Shared CEF course certification.</font></i>
</p>

- Part of the team took English speaking lessons, which will continue during 2024.
- Members of the Coordination team received personalized mentoring through [BetterUp](https://www.betterup.com/), also thanks to CZI.
- We participated as trainees, mentors, facilitators, and organizers in the [OLS Open Seeds program](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/ols-8/), with different projects. We finished the year building:
- **Governance 2.0**, collaborative writing of Community Guidelines and an intervention protocol; Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy; Authorship Guidelines, and a periodic update schedule for our governance. Team members are [Romina Pendino](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/authors/rominapendino/), Iván Poggio, [Pao Lefer](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/authors/plefer/), and Laurel Ascenzi, with Vero Xhardez as mentor.
- **Structure and infrastructure for virtual cohort training**, with team members Mónica Alonso, [Julián Buede](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/authors/jbuede/), Paz Míguez, Melissa Black, María Nanton, and Nicolás Palopoli, with mentorship by Gemma Turon.
  
All training efforts, partly financed by the 10% that we protect by contract for it, aim for the team’s continued development and growth as a reference for open science in Spanish-speaking Latin America.



## 2023 Advisory Committee 📜
MetaDocencia has the permanent support of its Advisory Committee. Following the Governance agreements developed by the community in 2022, the Committee completed its first year of work. Once a quarter, we hold meetings open to the full MetaDocencia team and with simultaneous interpretation in English and Spanish.

The Advisory Committee worked asynchronously on designing the Conflict of Interest Policy and the Authorship Guidelines, with valuable support from other folks on the team.

As established by our Governance, the partial renewal of the Advisory Committee is ongoing. Malvika Sharan and Laurel Ascenzi will leave their positions so that other people can have access to this decision-making body in MetaDocencia.

Thank you so much for your guidance and support during this time, Malvika and Laurel! 💐



## Press 📰
External media channels enhance MetaDocencia’s reach, recognition, and potential community audience.
We documented all 2023 media participations in a [special page on our website](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/prensas/) (in Spanish).

# 2024 Wishes 🌠

Thank you very much for joining us in continuing to build scientific and technical capabilities in a responsible manner and with a local perspective. We believe that it is the only way to move towards the globally equitable production, communication, and application of scientific and technical knowledge.

Our work is based on a vision of the future in which science and technology bring development, equality, and equity to our geographies and communities.

Therefore, even in contexts of adversity and multiple restrictions, we are committed to moving forward, with perseverance, confidence, and excellence; with teamwork, learning from mistakes, and networks of cooperation and exchange willing to build collectively.

This year, we also welcomed 3 MetaDocencia babies on the team. We share their little feet with you in the image that closes this report because we feel that they reinforce our daily commitment to the future.

We kick off 2024 working with more strength and conviction than ever for those who will come, for their growth, development, and a future of open doors for all people. This is our wish for this year that has just begun ✨
