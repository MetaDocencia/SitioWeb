## How does the initiative relate to Open Science?
PsiNet LAB is deeply committed to Open Science, ensuring that the results, codes, and methods are available in accessible repositories such as OSF and GitHub. In addition, the community organizes open classes to disseminate advanced methodologies, allowing more people to benefit from innovative approaches. All the scientific articles are open access, ensuring that the knowledge generated is available to all. PsiNet LAB also collaborates on projects with communities that speak indigenous languages, ensuring that the research is not only inclusive but also respects and values cultural diversity. This open and collaborative approach allows them to contribute to collective advancement and democratize access to science.

## What people does the initiative represent and include?
PsiNet LAB's initiatives encompass a wide variety of populations, including young adults, university students, and older adults, with a recent focus on Quechua speakers. They have not only conducted rigorous research but also organized both virtual and face-to-face outreach activities.
They promote initiatives such as BienEstar, dedicated to the dissemination of knowledge and promotion of academic activities for the general population on mental health and its most modern advances; as well as PsiNet EsCool, dedicated to bringing scientific training to students and teachers of schools in different regions of Peru from their educational centers.
These activities seek findings and methodologies from different groups, ensuring that everyone has access to information and useful tools to improve their well-being and psychological understanding. Through these efforts, PsiNet LAB seeks to promote inclusion and strengthen the ties between science and the community.
