Metadocence **was born from the need, but above all from the ability and desire to help**. Thirty days after its birth, more than **300 professionals** from differnet parts of the world have already 

_"The course was excellent. They gave me back the urge to teach. I hated everything about having to teach online, but they showed me that you can do something nice."_ The quote comes from Emmanuel Iarussi, who took our course [Introduction to the ABC's for virtualizing your classes](https://metadocencia.netlify.app/cursos/abc-online/intro-abc/). And he adds in his feedback: _"I couldn't even imagine the possibility of this being feasible. Teaching online can be much more humane than I could have ever imagined."_

After only one month, 108 teachers have already taken this course and joined the community which, added to the more than 200 who are already pre-registered make more than 300 professionals have joined the initiative.

Today is the first month since we started. We dreamt up MetaDocencia on March 16 and on the 23rd of that same month we opened the pre-registration form. We held the first workshop on March 27. Since then, we have given 7 more workshops and we have 3 mroe scheduled for the next few days with full registration. 

We initially targeted higher level teachers, but teachers of all levels showed interest: pre-school, primary, secondary and teaching institutions specialized in disciplines such as languages and music.

> To the teachers in the room, take advantage of the MetaDocencia resources. It's one of those things you didn't know you need.

Participants to our workshops come not only from Argentina, but also from Peru, Uruguay, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, United States, Canada, Spain and France. Argentinean teachers stranded by CODVID19 also joined us from other countries (such as England).

Teachers from 16 provinces in Argentina are participating in this initiative. More than 19,000 students in different disciplines and levels are being taught by teachers who participated in our introductory workshop.

At this time, we all are burdened by the need to change the way we work, learn, teach and, ultimately, live. For those of us who teach, this change has to be made with little or no time or resources. Moreover, so much is changing at the same time; all of it important. As Fernado Torres expresses in this tweet, MetaDocencia wants to be that friend that helps you understand where should you start, what can you do, what should you should aspire to.

> Today's course was excellent, super clear, didactic, applicable, one good recommendation after another, it all makes sense. 100% recommended. And also, free! I'm infinite grateful for the amount of dedication, empathy, and commitment.

The team of Metadocencia has a quote: "Shared joy is a double joy; shared sorrow is half sorrow". In times of isolation, the best guide for working online is found in the community. Nothing better than another teacher to understand and help a teacher.

Metadocencia seeks exactly that: to share knowledge and add experiences; to build, in short, a new learning in this utterly extraordinary context.
The key to making it work is to keep the [community growing](https://join.slack.com/t/metadocencia/shared_invite/zt-cq1hleoz-Ij2AgXKJBjg03sRuoxLhjg).
