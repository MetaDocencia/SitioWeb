MetaDocencia [celebrated its second anniversary](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/post/cumple_mes_dos_anios/) in 2022. This was made possible thanks to the support of the Spanish-speaking teaching community that grows along with innovations in education and the desire to continue learning and collaborating online.

The evolution of MetaDocencia is based on collective achievements, and our rapid growth presents new challenges. That motivated us to develop our governance practices in the second half of 2022. We aspire to have a transparent model for making strategic decisions that allows us to strengthen our institutional mission based on community construction.

To that end, between July and October 2022 we will hold eight sessions that aim to facilitate the development of collaborative governance. In these meetings we will speak with specialists in governance and leaders of organizations and projects in the fields of education and open knowledge. These sessions will help foment an organizational model for MetaDocencia, designed for and shaped by our cultural and regional context.

We invite you to join us and take part in the conversations, discussions, and reflections that will guide this learning process. Your participation will help us form our governance model and reach another milestone in our community-centered journey.
