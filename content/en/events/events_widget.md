Between July and October 2022 we will hold **eight talks** that aim to contribute to the collaborative development of our governance. In these meetings we will talk with specialists in governance and leaders of organizations and projects linked to education and open knowledge. These meetings will contribute to an organizational model like the one we want for MetaDocencia, designed from and for our cultural and regional context.

We invite you to participate in the conversations, debates and reflections that will guide this learning process, so that our form of government is another milestone in our trajectory built as a community.
