I am a postdoc researcher at Laboratorio de Estructura Molecular y Propiedades (LEMyP) at CONICET. I try to understand the inhibition mechanism of Cruzain, a cysteine protease involved in Chagas disease. Following that objective, I work with data analysis & machine learning.

I'm a Rladies chapter co-founder and co-organizer: *Rladies Resistencia Corrientes*, co-founder and co-organizer of a R user's group (RUG) at my local area called *R-en-el-NEA*, and one of the organizers of latinoamerican R Conference, *LatinR*.

Also, I am an #rstats teacher assistant at Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias (UNNE), creating new material with R programming for undergrad stats course.
