Paola is a History Professor and Museum Technician. She focused her training on Latin American contemporary history and teaching modalities at the middle school level. She has been participating and working in education-related fields (such as museums and middle education institutions) for 20 years.

She was trained in alternative tools for teaching history such as photography, literature and music. 

Currently she has added her training as a ceramist and uses these resources as an alternative way to teach.
