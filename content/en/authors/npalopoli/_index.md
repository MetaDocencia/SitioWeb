I work as a computational biologist.

I am interested in understanding the functional nature of macromolecules, with a special focus on their evolutionary relationships and their interactions in biological systems.

I develop and use computational tools for the analysis of biological sequences and structures.

My main focus are protein structure and intrinsic disorder, their interactions mediated by linear motifs and their evolution as modeled by substitution matrices.
