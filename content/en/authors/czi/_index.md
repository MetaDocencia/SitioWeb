### About CZI Open Science

**The [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/open-science/) program** supports the universal and immediate open exchange of all scientific knowledge, processes, and results. Its goal for the next 10 years is to support a diverse scientific community working openly to accelerate our understanding of human health and disease. To this end, it invests in tools, platforms, and organizations that help broaden participation and access to the scientific process by making it open and reproducible, and by helping scientists leverage the work of others.
