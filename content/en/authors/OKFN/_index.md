### About OKFN

The Open Knowledge Foundation ([OKFN](https://www.okfn.org/en/)) is a world reference in open digital infrastructures and the center of the open movement. The organization has been setting open standards for the past 20 years and providing services, tools and training for governments, organizations and communities to adopt openness as a design principle. Its most popular product, CKAN, is the tool behind open data portals such as those of the U.S., Brazilian and Indian governments, and the UN refugee agency. OKFN is the technology arm of a wide range of institutions that create, manage and publish open data.
