Celeste is a researcher at INTA in Balcarce and a professor in the Biochemistry department of the Faculty of Agrarian Sciences of the National University of Mar del Plata, both institutions that make up the Balcarce Integrated Unit.

She works in the Phytogenetic Resources, Genetics and Improvement group, developing activities in the INTA Wheat Genetic Improvement Plan, with emphasis on physiology and quality of seeds and development of new varieties of bread wheat.

She also actively participates in extension projects related to the implementation of agroecological gardens in institutions for children and young people in vulnerable situations, where she works collaboratively with students, teachers, researchers, citizens and extension workers from different disciplines.

She has been a university teacher for 20 years and during 2020 she had to roll up her sleeves with the team that integrates with virtual teaching.
