Amit is an RPI alumnus, and environmental engineer turned data strategist. He started his career collecting and using environmental data to clean soil and water, then disseminated water data with UN-FAO’s AQUASTAT. Recently he stepped down from his role as Data Director at ACDI/VOCA in order to pursue wider consulting and volunteering interests.

Amit’s deep commitment to empowering underprivileged communities comes from his experience growing up in 'developing countries' and witnessing every extreme in living conditions. As a person of Mexican and Indian heritage, Amit values diversity and is a proud advocate of women and minorities in the workplace.
