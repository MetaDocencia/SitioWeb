**Experience and Track Record**

Patricia holds a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and a Diploma in Data Science, Machine Learning and its Applications from the FAMAF of the National University of Cordoba. Since the beginning of 2021 she's a part of the Metadocencia accessibility team and in mid 2023 she joined the team in charge of Mapping Open Science communities, organizations and resources in Latin America. 

Her passion for learning and collaborating in various fields has led her to be an active part of different communities and mentoring programs. She participated as a mentee in Open Seeds, a mentoring and training program provided by the Open Life Science (OLS) community during cohort 7,and as a mentor during cohort 8. 

Her credentials include a certification as an Instructor by The Carpentries and as a tidyverse Instructor by Rstudio, reflecting Patricia's commitment to education and empowerment through technology. In addition, I am an active member in communities such as R-Ladies, the Carpentries, Latin-R and The Turing Way, where I contribute to and benefit from community learning.

Inside the team, she has won the Rocket Award because she is not afraid of challenges thanks to her power and dedication to the projects in which she represents us.
