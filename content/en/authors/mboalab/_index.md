### About MboaLab

**[MboaLab](https://mboalab.net/)** is an open and collaborative space located in Yaound√©, Cameroon. It is a laboratory for social innovation, community education, collaboration, and mediation in the service of the common good. It functions as a research and applied Center for Open and Citizen Science and was officially inaugurated in December 2017, aiming to catalyze sustainable local development and improve people's living conditions through open science.

Its primary mission is to make biotechnology research and tools more accessible to laboratories in Cameroon and Africa. There is a significant need for these communities to contribute to scientific research and projects aimed at local health problems. As a result of growth, on June 27, 2022, it was renamed Mboalab Biotech.
