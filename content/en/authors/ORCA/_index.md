### About ORCA

**[The Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA)](https://orcaopen.org/)** is an organization that seeks to make scientific research more transparent, equitable, and useful to society. ORCA promotes the adoption of open science as the default practice in research, working with all stakeholders in the ecosystem: researchers, funders, academic institutions, governments, industry, and philanthropic organizations.
To achieve this, the accelerator builds cross-sector coalitions that identify opportunities for joint actionâ€”whether by transforming policies, creating incentives, or developing evaluation frameworks that strengthen openness and equity in science.
Its working model focuses on developing prototypes or proof-of-concept initiatives that help demonstrate that change is possible, with the goal of making it scalable.
