I am a white Latina living in Guaran√≠ territory in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I am a scientist and programmer that believes in the democratization of science, based on open, just, and feminist science.

I commit myself to discuss and build spaces to include marginalized groups in science and education. I consider teaching a continuous learning process and that education is the practice of freedom.

I am a biologist with a doctorate degree in ecology, working with ecological modeling, biodiversity informatics, and reproducibility in ecology. Currently, I work in the private sector as a researcher building R packages and workflows to access restoration and conservation strategies in the Tropics. I also contribute to initiatives to teach R and reproducible workflows both in free and open courses and in the academic environment.
