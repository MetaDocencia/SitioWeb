### About ABRIR

**[ABRIR](https://abrirpsy.org/)**  (Advancing Big-team Reproducible Science through Increased Representation) is an international consortium of researchers that aims to identify the unique barriers faced by researchers from LMICs (low-to-middle income countries) while participating and leading in Big-Team/Open Science projects. ABRIR hopes to build a collaborative network of psychological science researchers from the Global South to explore and answer questions of deep relevance to their local regions.
