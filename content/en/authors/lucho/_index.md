Lucio has been working in the area of audiovisual communication for more than 15 years. Editing, recording and photography are the main areas in which his work stands out. He has participated in projects for television and film. 
According to his conception, new media and networks force the profession to be updated in order to generate content adaptable to all formats. 
The aerial vision opens a new field within the audiovisual, so Lucio decided to venture into the use of drones. He is an ANAC registered drone pilot. He is also a Photoreporter ARGRA No. 2517.
