Eunice is part of the Civic Science Fellows Network. She has large experience in science and technology policymaking. She has worked with government agencies such as Innovation Science and Economic Development Canada and the Quebec Ministry of Science and Innovation to develop to implement open innovation policies inclusive by design. 

She also was deputy director of science and technology policy at the National Council for Science and Technology in Mexico, where she designed and implemented the Open Science Policy in that country.
