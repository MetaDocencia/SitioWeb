**Experience and Track Record**

Laura is an Adjunct Research Scientist at the National Research Council in Argentina (CONICET) and the University of Buenos Aires, where she leads the Responsible Use of Data Co-Laboratory. 
She has over 50 peer-reviewed academic publications and has received funding  from prestigious international agencies such as NASA, NIH, and CZI.

She has more than two decades of experience offering consulting services and also experience working remotely from Buenos Aires since 2006. She has been a user of remote graduate education since then. Her first experience teaching at the undergrad and grad levels in 2013 was also remote for US-based students.

Since 2017 she has held leadership positions at or co-created local, regional, and international open-science-related collective projects (e.g., R-Ladies Global, LatinR, useR!, OLS, Code for Science & Society). Laura was also a The-Carpentries-certified instructor and instructor trainer and has experience developing massive online courses for a US-based platform (whose name we omit due to the company’s ethical issues). In March 2020, Laura co-founded MetaDocencia.

Inside the team, Lau has won the T-Shirt Award because she drives us, motivates us, teaches us, and empowers us on the court. Outwardly, she defends science, technology, education, and our geographies and future. She invites and brings others up to a thousand projects, shares her brilliant trajectory, and generously encourages us to play more and better.
