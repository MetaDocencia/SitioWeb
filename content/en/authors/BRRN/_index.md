### About the Brazilian Reproducibility Network

The [Brazilian Reproducibility Network](https://www.reprodutibilidade.org/en) is a multidisciplinary initiative to promote transparent and reliable research practices in the Brazilian scientific community. It brings together groups, institutions, and individuals around the country that work to evaluate and improve practices in different areas of science and to foster the debate about research reproducibility. It is part of an international network of other national communities that come together to exchange experiences and contribute to a more reliable science at a global level.
