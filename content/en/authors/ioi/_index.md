### About IOI

**[Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI)](https://investinopen.org/)** is an initiative dedicated to improving funding and resourcing for open technologies and systems that support research and training. It works on challenges, research, and with decision-makers to drive change.

IOI was founded on two basic premises: open, and community-owned infrastructure as it is necessary for research to thrive; and the way in which open projects are funded and resourced is insufficient and works against the goal of building a healthy, collaborative ecosystem.
