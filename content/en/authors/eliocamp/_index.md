Elio is doing a PhD in atmospheric sciences in the Center for Ocean and Atmospheric Research in which he studies the atmospheric circulation in the southern hemisphere and how it affects the weather in South America. He takes part in the Science Clubs Network, where he leads workshops for high-school and elementary-school students that teach scientific concepts. Since 2017 he also organises workshops about the R programming language in the Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales and as a founding member of the R User Group [R en Buenos Aires](https://renbaires.github.io/) since 2018.
