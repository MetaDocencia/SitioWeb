All persons participating in MetaDocencia, including members of the coordinating team, collaborators, advisory team and participants must accept and respect the following Community Guidelines. 

If you witness a situation that violates this Community Guidelines, please report it to [pdc@metadocencia.org](mailto:pdc@metadocencia.org) or any [Community Guidelines team member](#cdc_members).

## Scope

This Community Guidelines applies to all spaces related to MetaDocencia. This includes our email accounts, our Slack, our social networks, our workshops through Zoom, our GitHub organization and all its repositories, and any other media that is part of MetaDocencia.

## Responsibilities of the Community Guidelines Team

The Community Guidelines team, composed of MetaDocencia members, is responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and reserves the right of admission or removal, temporary or permanent, from the MetaDocencia community for any behavior deemed unacceptable. 

It also has the responsibility and reserves the right to remove, edit or reject comments, materials and other contributions that are not aligned with this Community Guidelines. 

Cases of unacceptable behavior may be reported by sending an email to [pdc@metadocencia.org](mailto:pdc@metadocencia.org) or to any member of the Community Guidelines team. All messages will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response appropriate to the circumstances. The privacy and security of those affected and/or reporting an incident will be respected at all times. 

Individuals who are part of the Community Guidelines team agree to recuse themselves in the event of a conflict of interest associated with an incident report.
