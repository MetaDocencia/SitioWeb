### Objectives 

In this practical you will learn to use different tools to assess how stereotypes can result in discriminatory behavior in language technologies and reflect on their social impacts. You will explore biases in large language models and word embeddings. Working in groups, you will find strengths and limitations in the representations of stereotypes and the different approaches to model bias. This is an introductory course and no previous natural language processing (NLP) knowledge is required.

### Intended public of this practical

**There are no specific requirements for this practical, you will experience it best if you bring a laptop.**

When we designed this practial, we had Sasha, Federico, Esther, Javier, and Sandra in mind.

* Sasha has a Master's in Physics and is pursuing her PhD in Complex Systems. They are a naturally shy person and sometimes finds it difficult to develop topics that do not have a strong technical structure, although they realize social issues and interpersonal skills are key in data science applications. Read more about Sasha here.

* Federico is finishing his undergrad degree in Math and has been working in a medium-sized Latin American technology company for 18 months as a machine learning engineer. He likes to code, he's a vegan, and he believes deeply in social justice. He believes that AI can be the solution to many of humanity's problems. Read more about Federico here.

* Esther is a sociologist and has been working for 3 decades in different technical areas of the Mexican public sector. She knows very well the written rules and unwritten customs of the different public administrations that handle massive data. She has taken courses on modernization and open data, however, they have seemed unclear and of little practical use. Read more about Esther here.
