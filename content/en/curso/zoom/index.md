### Objectives 

To learn and get used to options and tools of the online meeting platform Zoom to promote a comfortable and friendly classroom. We will think in your learners needs and decide which tools are appropiate to address them.

During this online workshop:

* You will set up your Zoom account in the best way given your classroom needs.

* You will practice how to manage a Zoom session.

* You will create and manage breakout rooms, with the possibility for you and other instructors to visit the small groups.

* You will schedule a Zoom meeting to practice the management of every detail in the frame of your own session.

### Intended public of this course

In order to take this workshop, we recommend you to take [Introduction to teaching essentials](https://metadocencia.netlify.app/en/curso/intro-abc-online/) before, it's not a requirement though.

When we designed this workshop, we had in mind Maria and Juan as our learner personas.

* Maria has been a University teacher for more than 30 years. Given her experience, she is very required for talks and seminars. She is very confident using email and WhatsApp.

* Juan splits his teaching time between delivering workshops for companies and classes at High-school. He has a lot of experience in technology tools, he teaches from Home. He takes care of his 2-yo and 4-yo daughters.
