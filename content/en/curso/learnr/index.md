### Objectives 

To introduce the {learnr} package and show how to use it to create interactive tutorials. These interactive tools allow the students to run R code directly in the tutorial, to answer to questions and to receive immediate feedback. 

### Intended public of this course

When we designed this workshop, we had in mind Josefina, Francisco and Alex as our learner personas. 

* Josefina teaches R at University. She is interested in giving automated feedback to the R exercises given to her students. 

* Francisco is a professional developer and wants to explore the interactive tutorials as possible part of the help and documentation of his packages. 

* Alex wants to develop tutorials to publish them as shiny applications so that their students could start right away with R without painful installations. 

Check out [personas](https://metadocencia.org/personas/) to read more about them.

### _Not_ included in this workshop

Since we only have 3 hours, a lot of things will be out of reach of the workshop. Among other things, we will not learn:

* Programming techniques 
* Theory of pedagogy
* Rmarkdown 
* Package development
