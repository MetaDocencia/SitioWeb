### Objectives 

To introduce basic good practices for classroom (or seminar, workshop, talk) in face-to-face, hybrid or online environments (e.g., using Zoom). Every detail of the workshop, from the demonstration of interest and pre-registration form to the feedback request at the end of the workshop, including its execution using Zoom, is a demonstration of the strategies that can be adopted or adapted to any synchronous teaching.

During this online workshop:

* We will demonstrate how to contact and prepare students to join a synchronous class

* We will demonstrate how to manage an up-to-20-person synchronous virtual classroom using Zoom

* We will see examples of how to create a positive environment for our audience

* We will have an introduction to the pedagogical concepts of:  
  - Designing classes keeping the audience that will be receiving the material in mind (learning personas)
  - Outlining a course content using concept maps
  - Formative evaluation with diagnostic power approximately every 15 minutes to know if your students are following the class and correct them on the fly when you detect that something is not clear to most of them
  - Participation in a joint collaborative document to take notes or solve formative assessments
  - Other bite-sized, evidence-based, and easy-to-implement pedagogical tools
  - Asking your audience for feedback after each class and the importance of including both positive and negative feedback

* We will present key sources, in increasing order of complexity, from which we will continue to learn pedagogical practices

* We will present MetaDocencia and how to join our educational community

### Intended public of this course

**There are no specific requirements for this course other than speaking Spanish.**

When we designed this workshop, we had in mind Juan, Andrea and Florencia as our learner personas.

* Juan splits his teaching time between delivering workshops for companies and classes at High-school. He has a lot of experience in technology tools, he teaches from Home. He takes care of his 2-yo and 4-yo daughters. 

* Andrea is 30 years old and has a postdoctoral fellowship. She won her first teaching position and knows a lot about the subject she will be teaching but has no teacher training and needs tools to be able to deliver the content efficiently.

* Florencia is a teacher of Information and Communication Technologies. She is the mother of a girl about to start elementary school. She knows that she needs to incorporate effective tools to update contents and formats and that would have positive impact on her students' vocation, educational and professional trajectories.
