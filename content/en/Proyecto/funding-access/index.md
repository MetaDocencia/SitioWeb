Researchers from low-to-middle-income Countries (LMIC), such as most countries in Latin America, often face more challenges in raising international funding than those from High-Income Countries (HIC). Language barriers and cultural differences increase the distance between most Latin American researchers and funders in HIC.

Consequently, inclusive and well-intentioned funders, such as CZI or Wellcome Trust, although willing to work with diverse research communities, do not fund as many proposals from LMICs as they would like. Often, applications submitted by researchers at LMICs are not seen as competitive enough per the fundersâ€™ requirements, even when the contents are fully aligned with the funding goals.

Furthermore, grant writing training is rarely available in Spanish, and it does not address cultural and mindset differences essential to successfully navigating the international funding scene. Moreover, we know of no grant writing training provided mainly by researchers working collectively from Latin America and with a record of successfully obtaining international funding, who can become role models for the trainees.

### Objectives
* Open access to specialized fund-raising skills, including implicit knowledge, by developing a curriculum that meets Spanish-speaking Latin American researchers where they are;
* Teach this curriculum for free because fees, even minimal ones, can be barriers in Spanish-speaking Latin America;
* Teach how to teach this curriculum, exponentiating its dissemination speed;
* Build and steward a safe and inclusive community of practice for Latin American researchers so they can feel safe working in a collaborative and abundance mindset rather than a competitive and scarcity mindset.

### More Information
MetaDocencia is working with [CZI](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) to fund work packages 1 to 3 from 2024-2025. We are open to continuing to co-create this project with all interested parties. Please get in touch with laura.acion@metadocencia.org if you are interested.
