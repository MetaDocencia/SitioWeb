In the framework of the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative, a comprehensive program of activities by NASA to support the advancement of science towards openness, MetaDocencia in collaboration with the fellow community 2i2c committed to developing specific educational content for TOPS ScienceCore. 

This proposal brings together curriculum modules associated with different specific disciplines, with the aim of increasing the knowledge and skills necessary to leverage NASA’s open tools and technologies for Earth and space research. Our training module focuses on the analysis of open satellite data useful for understanding and predicting floods, forest fires, and droughts.

### Objectives

* To offer resources to identify, extract, analyze, visualize, and report on data available through NASA’s Earthdata cloud, mainly from remote sensing, for three different scenarios: forest fires, drought, and flood risk.
* To reinforce the principles of reproducibility and transparency, and workflows in line with open science.

### More Information
All course materials will remain open, available in English and Spanish, and with content accessible in different dimensions. The proposal is offered as a collection of Jupyter notebooks on GitHub, with supporting material for teaching the course using the cloud either in-person or remotely. After completing this module, students will be able to adapt and reuse the scenarios for their own open science objectives related to environmental risks such as forest fires, droughts, and floods, which are common worldwide but require analysis at the regional level.
