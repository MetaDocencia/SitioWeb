The goal of this project was to create a community cloud infrastructure service and offer workflow solutions in the life sciences, promoting open and inclusive community practices as values, the infrastructure enabling these practices, and a “train-the-trainer” approach that empowers leaders of local communities to share their cloud infrastructure expertise with others in their communities in Latin America and Africa.

Improving the accessibility and usefulness of cloud infrastructure for global communities requires expertise in many areas such as pedagogy, infrastructure, and local knowledge. MetaDocencia collaborated on this project with 2i2c, OLS, IOI, CSCCE, and The Carpentries, with the goal of bringing together the skills needed to increase access to interactive computing services for open science communities in Latin America and Africa.
