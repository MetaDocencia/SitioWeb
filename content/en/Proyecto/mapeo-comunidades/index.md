This project was born at the beginning of 2023 to orient our practice towards Open Science with a local perspective. It consists of an interactive application developed using the Shiny package in the R programming language to provide information related to resources, events, workshops, funding opportunities, and open science communities in Latin America. 

It will be open to anyone interested in accessing resources on open science, connecting with other regional and local actors, or even participating in the promotion of open practices.

### Objectives
* Provide information related to resources, events, and open science communities in Latin America.
* Store and centralize updated and curated information that is easily accessible to anyone interested in the topic.
* Showcase the diversity of initiatives and even generate contact networks that enrich the exercise of open science in the region.
 
### More Information
To see a preview of this mapping you can access the [Shiny App](https://metadocencia.shinyapps.io/mapeo_comunidades/).
This is a project under development, so it may differ from its final version. We are managing funds for its financing.
