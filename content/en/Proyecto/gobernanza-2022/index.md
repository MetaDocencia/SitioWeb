In 2022, MetaDocencia embarked on a process of collective and collaborative learning to design our governance. The goal was to develop a transparent model for strategic decision-making, designed from and for our cultural and regional context.

The implementation of our new governance began in December 2022, with the formation of a new Advisory Council (CA) and the call for a first meeting according to the updated operating principles. The CA, along with the Management, Coordination, and other working teams, collaborate to ensure that decision-making and activity development enhance MetaDocenciaâ€™s work and mission.

In 2024 we worked specifically on MetaDocencia Governance 2.0, as we rethought, enriched, updated and formalized documentation related to the process.
