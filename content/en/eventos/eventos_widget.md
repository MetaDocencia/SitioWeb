Between July and October 2022 we will hold **eight talks** that aim to facilitate the development of collaborative governance. In these meetings we will speak with specialists in governance and leaders of organizations and projects in the fields of education and open knowledge. These sessions will help foment an organizational model for MetaDocencia, designed for and shaped by our cultural and regional context.

We invite you to join us and take part in the conversations, discussions, and reflections that will guide this learning process. Your participation will help us form our governance model and reach another milestone in our community-centered journey.
