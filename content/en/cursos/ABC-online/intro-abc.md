### Objectives 

To introduce basic good practices for classroom management using Zoom or similar online meeting platform. Every detail of the workshop, from the demonstration of interest and pre-registration form to the feedback request at the end of the workshop, and including its execution using Zoom, is a demonstration of the strategies that can be adopted or adapted to any teaching task that takes place interacting simultaneously with students (synchronous class).

During this online workshop:

* We will demonstrate how to contact and prepare students to join a synchronous class

* We will demonstrate how to manage a 15-person synchronous virtual classroom using the Zoom platform

* We will see examples of how to create a positive environment for our audience

* We will have an introduction to pedagogical concepts of:  
  - Designing classes keeping the audience that will be receiving the material in mind (learning personas)
  - Outlining the contents using concept maps
  - Formative evaluation with diagnostic power approximately every 15 minutes to know if your students are following the class and correct them on the fly when you detect that something is not clear to most of them
  - Participation in a joint collaborative document to take notes and/or resolve formative evaluations
  - Other bite-sized, evidence-based and easy-to-implement pedagogical tools
  - Asking your audience for feedback after each class and the importance of including both positive and negative feedback

* We will receive key sources, in increasing order of complexity, from which we will continue to learn pedagogical practices

* We will know what MetaDocencia is and how to join the educational community we are creating

### Duration

The workshop lasts 3 hours with intervals (ideally away from any screen) of approximately 5 minutes for every 50 minutes of content.

### What is _not_ included in this workshop

Since we only have three hours, a lot of things will be out of reach of the workshop. Among other things, we will not learn:

* In-depth treatment of strategies for teaching online
* Theory of pedagogy or educational sciences
* Specific techniques for teaching content from different fields of knowledge
* Specific techniques for handling classes of more than 30 people
